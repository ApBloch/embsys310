What is Morse Code:
  Morse code is a system for sending information using duration of signal high or low values. Morse code was used to send letters between operators to convay information. A 'dot' is a short signal and a 'dash' is a longer signal. The combination of dots and dashes create a unique letter in the alphabet. 
  
Who developed Morse Code:
  Samuel Morse developed the original system. They had a device that burned holes in a roll of paper in either dots or dashs that would correlate to a number that would then be looked up in a book to tell what word was sent. Alfred Vail took the code and included letters so the system could be used more easily.
